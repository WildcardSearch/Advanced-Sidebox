Advanced-Sidebox 1.3.6
===================

A plugin for MyBB forums that displays portal boxes on various forum pages.

Based on the code and concept of Nayar, this plugin seeks to give the admin more options and allow him to control the plguin in a more intuitive way. This plugin does not work with every theme, but is designed to work with most. It features several adjustments made to the original portal templates (which have been imported into the plugin and created as seperate editable templates) and enhancements in their operation and display.

Hooks have been installed into the plugin to allow other plugins to create and build sidebox types of there own that will add to the available box types in ACP to choose from. I have successfully integrated a test plguin into the structure. This plugin will probably become more extensible over time.

I will add more info as the project develops further.
