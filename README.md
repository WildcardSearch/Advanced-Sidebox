*A plugin for MyBB forums that displays custom boxes on various forum pages.*

This plugin seeks to give the admin more options when adding side boxes to the forum and allow control in a more intuitive way. This plugin edits the template cache and does not modify your forum's templates-- therefore it does not work with every theme but *is* designed to work with most.
