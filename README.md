*A plug-in for MyBB forums that displays custom boxes on various forum pages.*

This plug-in seeks to give the admin more options when adding side boxes to the forum and allow control in a more intuitive way. This plug-in edits the template cache and does not modify your forum's templates-- therefore it does not work with every theme but *is* designed to work with most.

## Features

* Now add and edit script definitions to further customize ASB! Also now compatible with Page Manager scripts.
* New add-on module added to the core: Recent Posts (AJAX Ready)
* AJAX Refresh now integrated into the core and five of the core modules (latest threads, PMs, random quotes, staff on-line and who's on-line avatar lists)!
* New Improved Drag and Drop Interface!
* Admin can control many settings for where and how side boxes display
* Eight scripts available! (Index, Forum, Thread, Member Profiles, Member List, Forum Team, Statistics and Portal)
* Choose one of many default presets with updated content or create semi-static custom boxes with HTML and template variables
* Import/Export custom boxes to share and backup your work
* Control which scripts side boxes display on
* Individual side box settings
* Extensive user group permissions for side boxes
* Now supports CodePress
* Newly redesigned On-line Staff module
* Context-sensitive help for ACP pages
